## Installation
1. Download and extract the zip archive of the OnTrack repository.
2. Navigate to the 'Project 5 OnTrack' directory.
3. Install the required gems with the following command:
```
$ bundle install
```
4. Construct the database and load content with the following command (this will take a couple minutes):
```
$ rails db:reset
```

## Usage
After installing the necessary gems and populating the database, use the following command to launch the server:
```
$ rails server
```
Following this command, you should be presented with a TCP link. You can
either copy and paste this, or type 'localhost:3000' into the web browser
of your choice.

**Accounts**
There are three different account types: Student, Teacher, and Admin. Each account type has different permissions regarding which section of the site they may access.

**Configuration**
The Configuration page is only accessible by Admins. This page is where an Admin may re-run the web scraper to get the most up-to-date class schedule. It is also where an Admin may specify how many graders need to be hired for certain classes, and whether or not attendance is required.

For example, all 2221 LAB classes in SU20 can be configured to have 2 grader positions with grader attendance required with one form submission.

**Administrator Panel**
This section is only accessible to Admins. This page shows the listings of classes, with details such as number of open grading positions and the names of graders currently assigned. This list may be filtered by semester, session, class name, and whether the classes have open grading positions.

Each class has an "Edit" link that takes the user to a new page. This page lists details of the current graders as well as candidates who are eligible to grade the class, including evaluations scores, recommendations, GPA, and grade in the class. If attendance is required for the class, only students who are available at the class meeting time will be shown. The Admin then has the option to remove or assign graders to the class.

**Application**
This section is for students to fill out an application to be a grader. Applicants fill out identifying information as well as classes they are interested in grading with the grade they received. Students must also specify which times they are available to grade the classes they are interested in.

**Recommendation**
